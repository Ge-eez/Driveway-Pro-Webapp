This is a webapp connecting parking service providers and drivers. It has originated from our Android class project. And it's for Web Developemnt I final project. 

Well, we know it has so many bugs and issues but we're doing our best to fix them and finish ASAP. 

For more info, please check the hosted webapp at https://ge-eez.github.io/Driveway-Pro-Webapp/ and feel free to reach out and give us your feedback. 

We're doing our best to implement all the possible technologies on client-programming and achieve the optimal state since we're not allowed to use backend. 


Thanks ;)
